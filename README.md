# KpGraph

KpGraph is a <b>custom Knowledge Graph of the persona Fibonacci (Type) space for evolution toward What Count, and Native Property Graph</b> of the (1) Persona, (2) Relationship, (3) Organization, and connecting (4) <a href="https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/" target="_blank">Code</a>. KpPlatform facilitates commercial and specialized interactions between legal [ Persona / Organization ] with available Services, and other Types such as Family, GsLp (Global service Local presence), etc, having standard GraphQL read-and-write for the Platform microservices.

KpGraph custom serves each legal entity integration between [ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvNvj7ku5pY" target="_blank">Aesthetic Normative Intelligence &gt;&lt; AI Positive Intelligence or <b>ability to [ Love / Not-Self ] at <u>States of Liberation</u> and Rational Thinking</b> in Conscious AI</a> ] where entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) are not only connections but also carry properties such as cultivable and rated "<b>myAwareness and mySamadhi</b>" for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o8wqs-LdDk" target="_blank">optimal training and visible properties in MyIntuition and MyPrajna</a> having proven modern tools such as <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/mu/" target="_blank">Mu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">EIP</a>, etc, using advanced <a href="https://www.arago.co/go-beyond-the-limits-of-robotic-process-automation-in-itsm/" target="_blank">Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</a> and available <a href="https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen" target="_blank">gqlgen</a> for low-code generation served by domain experts in SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), Relationships, Benefit-Cost Analysis with "<b>logically identified Type properties</b>" in designing GraphQL API to collect data. Golang is its main backend language to provide faster performance, and standard Javascript as its main front-end building on top of Facebook ReactJS and what best tools available outthere.

Starting from well-designed collected data, we generate a sequence of [ Guards / Sensors ] from deductive queries to a set of rapidly changing facts in Activities and Relationships at all Places. Via "<b>rule-based sensors / guards</b>", RAP (<b>Robotic Agent Programming</b>) executed in parallel can grap solid opportunities well suited to human/robot and/or robot/robot co-operative strategic tasks. It is an excellent opportunity to combine modern technologies and human strategic Think-on-Demand such as "<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/990091640036715580/pdf/How-Will-Viet-Nam-Blossom-Reforming-Institutions-for-Effective-Implementation-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Update-2021.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank Diagnostic Update 2022-05-18</a>" at the Vietnamese "Vision (Tầm Nhìn)", engineering required "Resources (Năng Lực)", "Motivation (Động Lưc) to optimally control significant factors for reaching the target.

The tools - once available - will be efficiently used at the grass roots to collect Big Data for "<b>Machine Learning</b>" and "<b>Pattern Detections</b>" to theoretically test all claims and statistically validate empirical outcomes according to underlying natural laws to "<b>Make Life Easier and Happier</b>" as done in human Health and Social Sciences.
