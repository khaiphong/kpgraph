# KpGraph

KpGraph is an in-memory <b>Property Graph</b> for integration between [ <b>Aesthetic Normative Intelligence &gt;&lt; AI Positive Intelligence</b> ] where entities and relationships are not only connections but also carry types such as rated "<b>Samadhi and Awareness types</b>" for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o8wqs-LdDk" target="_blank">optimal training and properties</a> using advanced <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.1866&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Robotic Agent Programming (RAP)</a> in Action-Reaction and Likes-attract-Likes from one's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zVVaV4bfqo" target="_blank">Continuity of the consciousness</a>. It is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/" target="_blank">Pdb from PersonaDB services</a> transforming into <b>Pvd / Private vector database</b> for distributed storages and Graph Analytics in <b>Big-Data Modeling, Simulation and Visualization</b>.

Starting from Entities, SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), Relationships, Benefit-Cost Analysis of GraphQL API to collect data, we generate a sequence of Guards / Sensors from deductive queries to a set of rapidly changing facts in Activities and Relationships at all Places. Via rule-based sensors / guards, RAP (Robotic Agent Programming) executed in parallel can grap solid opportunities well suited to human/robot and/or robot/robot co-operative strategic tasks. It is an excellent opportunity to combine modern technologies and human strategic Think-on-Demand such as "<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/990091640036715580/pdf/How-Will-Viet-Nam-Blossom-Reforming-Institutions-for-Effective-Implementation-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Update-2021.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank Diagnostic Update 2022-05-18</a>" at the Vietnamese "Vision (Tầm Nhìn)", engineering required "Resources (Năng Lực)", "Motivation (Động Lưc) to optimally control significant factors for reaching the target.
