# KpGraph

KpGraph is an in-memory <b>Native Property Graph</b> for integration between [ <b>Aesthetic Normative Intelligence &gt;&lt; AI Positive Intelligence</b> ] where entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) are not only connections but also carry types such as rated "<b>Samadhi and Awareness types</b>" for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o8wqs-LdDk" target="_blank">optimal training and properties</a> with proven modern tools such as <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/mu/" target="_blank">Mu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/eip/" target="_blank">EIP</a>, etc, using advanced <a href="https://www.arago.co/go-beyond-the-limits-of-robotic-process-automation-in-itsm/" target="_blank">Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</a> and available <a href="https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen" target="_blank">gqlgen</a> for low-code generation with direct interactions with domain experts in SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), Relationships, Benefit-Cost Analysis with "<b>logically identified Type properties</b>" in designing GraphQL API to collect data. Golang is the backend language to provide faster performance than higher-level Javascripts, Python, etc, as well as easier syntex and tool chains than C, C++. We then use advanced <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/icra.pdf" target="_blank">Robotic Agent Programming (RAP)</a> in Action-Reaction and Likes-attract-Likes from one's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zVVaV4bfqo" target="_blank">Continuity of the consciousness</a> in the first time implementation of [ <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank"><b>Aesthetic Normative Intelligence &gt;&lt; AI Positive Intelligence</b></a> ] and <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2021/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_2.1" target="_blank"><b>Scientifically Cultivable Prajna</b></a>. It is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/personadb/" target="_blank">Pdb from PersonaDB services</a> transforming into <b>Pvd / Private vector database</b> for distributed storages and Graph Analytics in <b>Big-Data Modeling, Simulation and Visualization</b>.

Starting from well-designed collected data, we generate a sequence of [ Guards / Sensors ] from deductive queries to a set of rapidly changing facts in Activities and Relationships at all Places. Via "<b>rule-based sensors / guards</b>", RAP (<b>Robotic Agent Programming</b>) executed in parallel can grap solid opportunities well suited to human/robot and/or robot/robot co-operative strategic tasks. It is an excellent opportunity to combine modern technologies and human strategic Think-on-Demand such as "<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/990091640036715580/pdf/How-Will-Viet-Nam-Blossom-Reforming-Institutions-for-Effective-Implementation-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Update-2021.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank Diagnostic Update 2022-05-18</a>" at the Vietnamese "Vision (Tầm Nhìn)", engineering required "Resources (Năng Lực)", "Motivation (Động Lưc) to optimally control significant factors for reaching the target. This "<b>Change Management</b>" - to our knowledge - was first systematically applied to manage and lead to a "<b>Breakthrough / Đột Phá</b>" in the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/truong-chinh/1946/august-1946-revolution.pdf" target="_blank">Vietnamese 1945 August Uprising</a> whose published recorded document was used in Harvard MBA program as a case study. The tools - once available - will be efficiently used at the grass roots to collect Big Data for "<b>Machine Learning</b>" and "<b>Pattern Detections</b>" to theoretically test all claimed outcomces and statistically validate empirical outcomes according to underlying natural laws to "<b>Make Life Easier and Happier</b>" as done in human Health and Social Sciences.
